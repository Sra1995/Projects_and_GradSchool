# Increment Performance Test

## Overview
This project is designed to compare the performance of postfix (`i++`) and prefix (`++i`) increment operations in C++. The primary goal is to evaluate the practical performance difference between the two approaches, given the commonly held notion that postfix increment is slower due to its use of a temporary variable.

## Code Structure
The program consists of the following functions:

1. **`basic_increment_postfix`**:
   - Uses a `while` loop to increment an integer variable `i` from 0 to `n` using `i++`.
   - Measures the time taken for this operation using `std::chrono::high_resolution_clock`.

2. **`basic_increment_prefix`**:
   - Uses a `while` loop to increment an integer variable `i` from 0 to `n` using `++i`.
   - Measures the time taken for this operation using `std::chrono::high_resolution_clock`.

3. **`basic_increment_postfix_for`**:
   - Uses a `for` loop to increment an integer variable `i` from 0 to `n` using `i++`.
   - Measures the time taken for this operation.

4. **`basic_increment_prefix_for`**:
   - Uses a `for` loop to increment an integer variable `i` from 0 to `n` using `++i`.
   - Measures the time taken for this operation.

5. **`main` Function**:
   - Hardcodes the value of `n` (e.g., `n = 1000000000`).
   - Calls each of the four increment functions in sequence.
   - Outputs the final value of `i` and the time taken for each operation.

## How to Compile and Run

To compile the program, use the following command:

```bash
g++ -o increment_test increment_timer.cpp -std=c++17
```

To run the program, use the command:

```bash
./increment_test
```

## Reason for the Experiment
The project tests the claim that:
- Postfix increment (`i++`) uses a temporary variable, making it slower than prefix increment (`++i`), especially in performance-critical applications.

This test provides a concrete comparison by running both operations with the same value of `n` and measuring the time taken to complete the increments.

## Results
**Placeholders for Discussed Data**:
- **Postfix (while loop)**:
  - Average time: `[PLACEHOLDER]`
  - Median time: `[PLACEHOLDER]`
  - Standard deviation: `[PLACEHOLDER]`

- **Prefix (while loop)**:
  - Average time: `[PLACEHOLDER]`
  - Median time: `[PLACEHOLDER]`
  - Standard deviation: `[PLACEHOLDER]`

- **Postfix (for loop)**:
  - Average time: `[PLACEHOLDER]`
  - Median time: `[PLACEHOLDER]`
  - Standard deviation: `[PLACEHOLDER]`

- **Prefix (for loop)**:
  - Average time: `[PLACEHOLDER]`
  - Median time: `[PLACEHOLDER]`
  - Standard deviation: `[PLACEHOLDER]`

## Conclusion
**Placeholders for Conclusion**:
- Summarize whether the results align with the theoretical expectation that prefix increment is faster due to avoiding the overhead of a temporary variable.
- Provide insights into whether the difference is significant enough to matter in real-world applications.
