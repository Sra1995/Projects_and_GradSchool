Project Description:
This project involves creating a custom version of the 'xxd' program that contains 5 options. The program performs a hex dump of a given file, providing options for various output and formats.

Platform/Language:
    C language
    Tested on MCT263 machines/Sloop/Clipper

Files Included:
    Source Code: myxxd.c
    Header Code: Standard C language headers
    Supplemental: readme, makefile, documentation, test.txt

How to Compile:
1. `make`
2. `gcc myxxd.c -o myxxd`

How to Run:
1. `./myxxd [options] [infile [outfile]]`
   - Option is not required
    -no option: `./myxxd [infile [outfile]]` or `./myxxd [infile]`
   - Options:
        - `-v`: Show version string
        - `-h`: Print a summary of available commands and exit
        - `-p`: Output in postscript continuous hexdump style
        - `-b`: Switch to bits (binary digits) dump
        - `-a`: Toggle autoskip
        - `-l len`: Stop after writing <len> octets
        - `-g bytes`: Separate the output of every <bytes> bytes

Known Bugs: based on experminets conducted in documentation N/A.
