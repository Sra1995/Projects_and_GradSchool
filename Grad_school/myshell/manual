NAME
     myshell - a simple command-line shell program

SYNOPSIS
     #include "util.h"
     #include "shell_commands.h"
     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <stdlib.h>
     #include <string.h>
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/wait.h>
     #include <unistd.h>

DESCRIPTION
     MyShell is a simple command-line shell program that provides a set of basic commands to interact with your operating system. It supports both internal and external commands.

     Internal commands include:
           • mycd <directory>
           • myclr
           • mydir <directory>
           • myenviron
           • myecho <comment>
           • myhelp
           • mypause
           • myquit

     External commands are interpreted as program invocations and executed by forking and creating a child process.

     The shell environment includes a customizable prompt displaying the current directory.

BUILDING AND RUNNING
     To build MyShell, use the provided Makefile:

     ```bash
     make
     ```

     After building, run the shell:

     ```bash
     ./myshell
     ```

INTERNAL COMMANDS
     - `mycd <directory>`: Change the current default directory.
     - `myclr`: Clear the screen.
     - `mydir <directory>`: List the contents of the specified directory.
     - `myenviron`: List all environment strings.
     - `myecho <comment>`: Display a comment on the display.
     - `myhelp`: Display the user manual using the more filter.
     - `mypause`: Pause the operation of the shell.
     - `myquit`: Quit the shell.

EXTERNAL COMMANDS
     All other command-line input is interpreted as program invocation. MyShell forks and execs the program as its own child process. The programs are executed with an environment that contains the entry: parent=<pathname>/myshell.

CUSTOMIZING THE PROMPT
     The command line prompt contains the pathname of the current directory.
