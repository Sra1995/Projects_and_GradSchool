1.make
2.gcc lab2.c -o lab2
How to run:
1. ./lab2 num1 num2 operator . i.e ./lab2 1 2 +

Known bugs:
1. the program is limited to 10 digites for each number. Hence if you add a sign before the 10 digits it will be considered as 11 digits input and will cause an error.
2. the lab required the use of int data type, hence the program will not be able to handle large numbers compared to long long data type. 10 digits times 2 for example or adding two 10 digits numbers.
