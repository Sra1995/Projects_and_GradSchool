project Description : 
    A program that takes input file that has two numbers and perfrom a selected scheudling alogirhtm on them. 
    Then it creates a new file that has the result of the selected scheudling algorithm.
     After that it prints average wait time and average turnaround time and the Average normalized turnaround time.

Platform/Language:
    C language
    MCT263 machines/Sloop/Clipper
File Included :
    Source Code : mydispatcher.c algorithms.c utils.c
    Header Code : standard C language headers utils.h algorithms.h
    Supplemental : readme, makefile, documentation, input.dat, typescript
How to compile :
1.make

How to run:
1. ./mydispatcher input.dat <algorithm>

- For algorithms it is FCFS, RR, SRT, SPN.
- need to input a quantom size for RR algorithm. ie if i want q = 4 i will do ./mydispatcher input.dat RR 4
